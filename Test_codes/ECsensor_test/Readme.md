  In order to guarantee precision, a temperature sensor such as DS18B20 is needed, to execute automatic temperature compensation.
  You can send commands in the serial monitor to execute the calibration.
  Serial Commands:
 *   enterec -> enter the calibration mode
 *   calec -> calibrate with the standard buffer solution, two buffer solutions(1413us/cm and 12.88ms/cm) will be automaticlly recognized
 *   exitec -> save the calibrated parameters and exit from calibration mode
