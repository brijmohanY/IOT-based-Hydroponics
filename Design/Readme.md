Design is very important aspect of any hydroponics system 
We plan to do  NFT  ( Nutrient film technique )  of which different pipes were stacked vertically over two adjacent walls .
And designed in such a way that there is plenty of space for individual plant to grow .
The frame design is attached in this folder of repo 
Also mixing flow diagram and List of items used is attached .
